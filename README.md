**The Client**

Your Client is the Asia-Pacific office of ABC Women Foundation. ABC Women Foundation is an entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. A global champion for women and girls, ABC Women Foundation was established to accelerate progress on meeting their needs worldwide. ABC Women Foundation supports various countries as they set global standards for achieving gender equality and works with governments and civil society to design laws, policies, programmes and services needed to ensure that the standards are effectively implemented and truly benefit women and girls worldwide. 

Home to approximately 60 percent of the world’s population, the Asia-Pacific region is culturally, politically and economically diverse, with little sense of shared regional heritage beyond the respective sub-regions of South Asia, East/Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Despite this diversity, the region shares common challenges of migration, increasing socio-economic disparities, a rise in catastrophic natural disasters, and diverse cultures with entrenched cultural norms which perpetuate gender-based discrimination and makes combating violence against women a continued challenge. Internal and cross-border conflicts and limited rule of law in more fragile states impact livelihoods in several countries across the region; while the risks of climate change threaten island states and coastal areas. 

ABC Women Foundation actively programmes in twenty-two countries in the Asia Pacific Region, which folds in three sub-regional offices and eight nascent and existing country offices including one in India. 

**The Project**

ABC Women Foundation has recently launched a project in India. This 10-year transformational project aims to improve the standard of living of widows in the country and reduce the social stigma faced by them. 

It is estimated that there are more than 55 million widows in India. Studies indicate that widows in India face many issues owing to their lack of financial security, welfare infrastructure and social stigma. These issues vary from region to region and are heavily influenced by the socio-political dynamics of the various regions. The first part of the project is concerned with studying these variations to develop a map of India, corresponding to the issues faced by widows in different parts of the country. 

Following this, the project will work with widows’ coalitions, so they can speak up and access public services, and finally by guaranteeing that discriminatory social practices against widows are reviewed and repealed. Plans are also afoot to work with local community leaders, so they can help to champion the cause of widows. This component is scheduled to have various sub-components each of which will pertain to various thematic areas such as public policy, law and regulations among others. This is done with the aim of having a transformative impact on the overall living standards of widows. 
Since this is a long-term transformational project, ABC Women Foundation will launch several small projects that will serve to further the progress of a component or sub-component. 

**Your Role**

You represent a company that has been hired as a lead consultant on a specific short-term project that is part of this transformational long-term project. Your task is to form a women’s Self-Help Group in Manipur, comprising of widows who have been left without financial stability owing to the death of their husbands (or primary breadwinners) in the gun violence of the state. It will be your task to form and convert this SHG into a self-sustained business unit that provides a steady income to those women who are part of it. Your project is being considered as a pilot, whose model, if successful, will be replicated in other areas of conflict in India and its neighbouring countries. 

An important factor to keep in mind is that while the case solution must be specific to Manipur, you should try to make space for its replicability.

Given below are a few tasks that are outlined to help you solve this case. Please note that these tasks are indicative. While we are looking for you to address these issues, please feel free to bring in points of analyses that are not mentioned below. 

Important: Number of widows in Manipur who live in poverty= 20,000. 

**Task 1:** Selecting a geographic area for the intervention 
1. How would you go about selecting a geographic area where the SHG would be formed? 2. What would be your criteria for evaluation?
   
2. Would you first conduct a survey? If yes, please mention the nature of the survey, the approach and methodology for the survey including your thoughts on how you would design the sampling plan

**Note**: You may, on the basis of secondary research, select an actual area in Manipur. Alternatively, you could just answer the questions above, and provide any other relevant information and proceed with the case by selecting village ‘X’ as your region. In this section, you are not being tested on your knowledge of Manipur, but instead the logic of your argument. 

**Once the area has been selected… **

**Task 2:** Forming the SHG 
1. What steps would you take to set up the SHG? (The aim of this question is to point you in the direction of talking about processes, who you might consider important stakeholders and membership of the SHG)
  
2. How would you identify the business/product that the SHG would work with? (The aim of this question is to get you to think of a methodology for selecting a product for the business, while outlining the parameters for your choice, similar to what you did for task 1)
   
3. On the basis of an understanding of the socio-political conditions of the state in general, and your chosen geographic area specifically, what are the key challenges you foresee? How would you mitigate them (In answering this question, you should be able to identify powerful actors in that geographic area, and how they might respond to this initiative? Again, you are not being tested on your knowledge of Manipur. Your logical reasoning, and general awareness of the social sector will be assessed. The answers do not need to be specific and detailed, as long as you justify your thought process adequately.
   
Note: To make your analysis more robust, you may assume reasonable facts and figures. For instance, while selecting a product, you may assume that your chosen geographic area specialises in a certain product. In addition, you may assume the number of producers, number of consumers and other such facts to make a business case for a sustainable business. 

**Once the area has been selected, SHG has been formed and the product for their business has been selected… **

**Task 3:** Making the SHG ready for business
1. Estimate the Market Size 
2. Estimate Fixed and Variable Costs 
3. Estimate the Breakeven point 
4. Estimate each woman’s yearly earnings 
5. List any specific recommendations you may have for the way forward. (This could be about this SHG specifically, or the replicability of the project, or anything else you may deem fit.
   
Note: There is no right or wrong answer, although these questions are objective. You must make assumptions pertaining to numbers you have presumably decided upon in the first task. The only information given to you is that the number of widows in Manipur who live in poverty are 20,000. Please note that the most important thing for this task is that you clearly state the assumptions on the basis of which the calculations are being done. For instance, of the 20,000 widows, only a select number will be part of your SHG. How you arrive at that number is an assumption you make. 

**All calculations must be done on excel and clearly explained.**

Instructions 
1. You will be provided 8 hours to solve this case 
2. Be as creative as possible. The questions are only guidelines to help you start thinking. You do NOT need to adhere to them strictly. 
3. All assumptions must be clearly stated 
4. A PowerPoint presentation, utilising data visualization tools wherever applicable, is to be made on the basis of your case analysis. Your presentation skills will be assessed. 5. All calculations are to be done on excel and adequate explanations and assumptions must be provided. You will be assessed on your usage of excel functions. 
6. When conducting secondary research to answer qualitative questions or substantiate assumptions, all the sources must be cited.
